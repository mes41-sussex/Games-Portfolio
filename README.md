# Portfolio README

## Description

This is a small portfolio of games I have programmed. Both are heavily based on YouTube tutorials, but with changes made by myself:

- *asteroids.exe*: I changed the images of asteroids to be various 2016 US Presidential candidates. This was, of course, a relevant joke at the time.
- *Evade Alpha 1.2.1 720p.jar*: I added a Changelog to show miscellaneous small features that were added. This can be activated by pressing `C`
